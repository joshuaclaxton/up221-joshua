## Hi, I'm Joshua 
![My profile](https://github.com/joshuaclaxton/up221-joshua/blob/main/IMG_0737.jpg)
My family originates from West Africa, but New Jersey & New York City is home and some of my formative time was spent in Jordan. My diasporic identity and deep immersion in Arabic speaking communities has informed much of my work and post-colonial research interests. In my free time, I enjoy all fitness activities (latest pursuit is calisthenics), any book on history or philosophy or speculative fiction, and I still hope to be a composing pianist when I grow up.

## UP221: GIS and Spatial Data Science
Our coursework will delve into the fundamentals of urban spatial analytics, unlocking the power of maps to explain social, political and economic phenomena. We will use various components of data’s journey—acquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization—to enable and advance our research from a data science perspective.

We will learn the basics of programming with Python, spatial analysis through Python Libraries, and advanced geoprocessing. At the conclusion of this course, we will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.

## Research ideas
I am particularly interested in the prevalence and prevention of both state and in-community violence in black urban communities, enfranchisement and social movements.


## Objectives 
I hope to learn where to find geo-spatial data, what questions to ask once I have obtained a dataset, and how to carry out the necessary analyses.
