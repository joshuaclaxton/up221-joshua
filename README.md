## Hi, I'm Joshua 
!
My family originates from West Africa, but New Jersey/New York City is home and some of my formative time was spent in Jordan. As an avid vegan and self-proclaimed chef, Joshua wastes way too much time cooking, but loves every bite of his own creations. Otherwise, he enjoys all fitness activities (latest pursuit is calisthenics), any book on history or philosophy or speculative fiction, and still hopes to be a composing pianist when he grows up.
